# Spotify Data Analysis

The main goal of this project is to find out what properties a song needs to have to be popular. I will try to approach this question from two different angles and work with the two datasets:

Dataset A: UK Number 1 vs. random songs (ca. 2,600 observations of 16 variables)
It contains data from approximately 1,300 songs that were Number 1 songs in the UK (from playlist “Every Official UK Number 1 Ever” from user “Official Charts”) and 1,300 random songs.

For Dataset A the aim is to detect the main differences between the two groups.

Dataset B: 10,000 random songs (ca. 10,000 observations of ca. 200 variables)
